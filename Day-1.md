# The things that I have learned in my first day of coding:

## Markdowns and building my notes journal

* I have learned how to use the bare basics of Markdown, which is the knowledge that is allowing me to even write this webpage, pretty cool! Using simple commands allow me to change simple things about the webpage, such as the headings, listing points, and maybe more.
* Learning a growthmind set is what is going to allow me to succeed in programming as a career, I will those skills to get past any challenge that might come up.

## Terminals and Code Editors

* I have learned how to use a terminal in many different ways, ranging from installing apps, adding and moving through my directories, and even how to boot up apps in order to code more efficiently.
* There are many different types of code editors out there, each of them different, but all of them allowing me to write my code with the least amount of issues. Which is turn will allow me to improve on my skills.
* While you can use a basic editor like there is in **GitHub**, using something like **Visual Studio** will give you more options and shortcuts to decrease the amount of repetition that you will be going through as you write code.
