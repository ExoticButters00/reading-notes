# Personal Reading Notes

## Introduction

My name is Thomas and I am excited for this journey into learning programming!

I enjoying gaming, I mainly play Call of Duty and Minecraft (where I enjoy playing with my better half). I love spending time with my wonderful and energetic kids (all four of them).

## Growth Mindset

Growth mindset to me means that I should start any new project with the idea that I will learn as I write and to keep a positive mindset in order to keep growing.

***Three Reminders for Growth Mindset***

* Don't get frustrated - Everyone starts from somewhere!

* I can always do better - Keep on trying to learn!

* Challenge yourself - Try new things!
