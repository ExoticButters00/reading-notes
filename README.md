# Personal Reading Notes
*My reading notes journal for Code Fellows*

## Introduction
My name is Thomas and I am excited for this journey into learning programming!

I enjoying gaming, I mainly play Call of Duty and Minecraft (where I enjoy playing with my better half). I love spending time with my wonderful and energetic kids (all four of them).


## Growth Mindset
Growth mindset to me means that I should start any new project with the idea that I will learn as I write and to keep a positive mindset in order to keep growing.

***Three Reminders for Growth Mindset***
* Don't get frustrated - Everyone starts from somewhere!
* I can always do better - Keep on trying to learn!
* Challenge yourself - Try new things!
