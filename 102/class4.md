## Programming with JavaScript Notes

* **Control flow** is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script

* Use **conditional** structures or `if...else` so the code can execute depending on if the form is complete or not.

* Example of **control structures** include **conditionals**, **loops**, and **functions**.

* A **function** is a block of code that is designed to perform a particular task, and is executed when *something* invokes it.

* `function` is followed by a **name**, followed by parentheses **()**. An example would be `function exampleName(test1, test2, test3)`

* Function **parameters** are listed in the ().

* Function **arguments** are the **values** received by the function when it is invoked.

* The code inside the function will execute when something **invokes** the function: When an event occurs (clicking a button), when it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code, and automatically (self invoked).

* When the code reaches a `return` statement, the function will stop executing.

* Once invoked, the code will return to execute the code after the invoking statement.

* Loops helps reuse code so it can produce different results.

* The **assignment** operator `=` assigns a value to a variable.

* The **addition** operator `+` adds numbers

* The **multiplication** operator `*` multiplies numbers.

* The many types of JavaScript include: Aritmetic, Assignment, Comparison, Logical, Conditional, and Type Operators.
