# Reading Notes for Day 2

Today is the day that we started to learn about pushing code to GitHub and our repo using VS and using a terminal. Starting from creating and moving around the directory, to cloning my GitHub repo to my terminal so I can edit from my computer rather than use GitHub itself. Then I learned how to write the code in VS and then use ACP (Add-Commit-Push) in order to push any changes to my code to update my GitHub page.

## Important information to remember

* Remember ACP (Add-Commit-Push)

* Use `git status` like "salt" to verify all edits to code are following ACP.

* Always try and clean up your code and use proper commit comments to create good habits for coding.
